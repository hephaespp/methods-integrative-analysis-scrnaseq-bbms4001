- reference_genomes/

This directory contains the fasta files of the reference genome sequences used
for the abundance estimation. bowtie2 indices will be created here too. 

- reference_paths

This text file contains the file paths to the reference_genomes. Normally, it is
easier if the paths are absolute paths to the files, but for the sake of port-
ability of this example, paths relative to the example root directory have been
used.  

- sample1.fastq / sample2.fastq

Two genomic samples with differential abundances generated from the references.
